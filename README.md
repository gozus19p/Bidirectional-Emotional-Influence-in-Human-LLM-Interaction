This repository contains the code, datasets, and resources used in the experiments presented in the paper:

**Bidirectional Emotional Influence in Human–LLM Interaction: Empirical Analysis and Methodological Framework**  
_CLIC-it 2025 - Eleventh Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics._

## Overview

The study investigates how emotional tone influences interactions between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs), and vice versa. It is based on two experiments:

- **Experiment Alpha** – Evaluates how LLM-generated emotions impact human responses.
- **Experiment Omega** – Assesses whether fine-tuned LLMs with emotional bias exhibit behavioral divergence when queried.
